This Python program helps you:

- Calculate the minimum payment on a credit card.

- Figure out how long it will take to pay off a credit card balance.

- Show how often your balance is over 25%, 50%, or 75% of your credit limit.

- Estimate how interest and fees affect how fast you can pay it off.

You input your credit card details like:

- your current balance

- APR (interest rate)

- your credit limit

The program:

- Calculates the minimum payment (2% of your balance + any fees, but never below $25).

- Calculates monthly interest based on your APR.

- Repeats the payment process month-by-month until the balance is gone.

- Counts how many months your balance was over 25%, 50%, and 75% of your credit limit.

It prints out:

- The recommended minimum payment

- How many months it will take to pay it off

- How long you were over 25%, 50%, or 75% of your credit line.


Example of how to use: 

credit_calc.py = The name of the Python file.

You run the program by inputing something like the following into the command line: python credit_calc.py 1200 15 5000

1200 = your credit card balance ($1200)

15 = APR (15%)

5000 = your credit limit

Then it calculates how much your minimum payment should be, how many months it will take to pay off your balance, 
and how many of those months your balance stays over 25%, 50%, and 75% of your credit limit.
